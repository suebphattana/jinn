/**
 * Jinn Talk — streamed audio player (Phase 2 real loop).
 *
 * Plays base64-encoded audio chunks (a complete WAV per sentence from the local
 * Kokoro TTS backend) IN ARRIVAL ORDER with low latency, and exposes an
 * AnalyserNode so the AURA orb can react to the REAL output audio (RMS level)
 * while it speaks.
 *
 * Design:
 *  - One shared AudioContext (created lazily, resumed on the first user gesture).
 *  - Each `talk:audio` frame is a SELF-CONTAINED WAV. The backend speaks one
 *    sentence per call, so the per-frame `seq` resets to 0 each sentence — it is
 *    NOT a turn-global counter and must not be used to gate playback. Frames
 *    arrive in order over a single WS connection, so we simply play them in
 *    arrival order.
 *  - Decode + schedule is serialized on a promise chain so the moving "playhead"
 *    clock stays correct and chunks are scheduled back-to-back with no gaps,
 *    clicks, or overlaps — regardless of how fast each chunk decodes.
 *  - Every source routes through a single AnalyserNode → destination, giving the
 *    page a continuous signal to read regardless of which chunk is playing.
 *  - `onIdle` fires once the queue fully drains (used to settle the avatar).
 *
 * Decode errors are swallowed per-chunk (we skip the bad chunk) so playback
 * never stalls on one corrupt frame.
